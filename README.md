This program uses Java swing components to create a GUI application that allows the user to enter 2 values in 2 seperate text fields.

From there, the user can either add the 2 numbers or subtract them. The result of the operation is printed to the screen. 

If one of the values the user has entered is not a number, an error message will pop up and the user will be prompted to enter a new value.
